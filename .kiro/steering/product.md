# Product Overview

Moatless Tree Search is a research framework implementing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for software engineering tasks, specifically designed for automated code editing and bug fixing on the SWE-Bench dataset.

## Core Purpose
- Enhances software agents with tree search and iterative refinement capabilities
- Implements the SWE-Search method from the research paper "SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Iterative Refinement"
- Provides a modular, extensible framework for automated software engineering tasks

## Key Features
- **Tree Search**: Uses MCTS to explore solution spaces systematically
- **Multi-Agent System**: Supports discriminator agents, feedback generators, and value functions
- **Code Understanding**: Integrates semantic search, code indexing, and repository analysis
- **Testing Integration**: Connects with testbed environments for validation
- **Visualization**: Includes Streamlit interface for trajectory analysis and debugging

## Target Use Cases
- Automated bug fixing and code repair
- Software engineering research and evaluation
- Code understanding and navigation
- Benchmark evaluation on SWE-Bench datasets
